Please note, this is a first pass at generating this data. Also note that shapefiles are representative and do not pair with existing OSM networks. This will likely need to be finessed by hand as the paths imputed are based on general route trajectory and do not "pick" a real path when variance along multiple feasible OSM ways is detected.
